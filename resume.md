## Experience
#### May 2018 - Sept 2019
### Customer Representative | Sykes Enterprises | Provo
As a customer representative I was in charge of walking customers, who called in with questions, 
through the process of how to use their credit cards. I helped with both tech problems, 
that customers ran into when using their banking app, and answered general questions about their credit cards. 
I was a team leader on a special project team to help further the customer’s experience with digital tools. 
I was also a member of multiple focus groups designed to initiate ideas to better the customer’s overall experience. 
I also had the opportunity to be put in another special leadership program where I helped guide and teach other 
customer representatives to become successful within the company. I helped these representatives by answering 
questions and taught them good business practices to assist them in potentially moving up in the company.

#### Sept 2017 - May 2018
### Janitor | Timpview High School | Provo
As a Janitor I helped clean and maintain Timpview High School. I was often in 
charge of helping to organize a group to clean specific areas of the building 
in a timely manner. 

#### July 2015 - July 2017
### Missionary | The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints | Belgium/Netherlands
For two years I was a missionary for the LDS church. I served in Belgium and 
The Netherlands speaking Dutch. I was a leader of 20 other missionaries and 
helped keep them motivated and organized. I helped the missionaries by working 
with them one on one and giving large group presentations to help them find new 
and creative ways to succeed. I learned how to work with many different types of 
people from this experience and gained many leadership qualities that helped me succeed. 
One of the biggest things I learned was how to work as a team and allow everyone to use 
their strengths to help the team achieve goals we had set. 


#### April 2015 - July 2015
### Car Detailer | Autobahn Motors Corp | Bountiful
Autobahn Motors Corp is a family owned car dealership. I was hired to help keep cars in 
good condition and looking clean for customers who came to test drive and inspect vehicles. 
I washed the outside of every vehicle and meticulously detailed the interior of every vehicle 
that came onto the lot.
